;; Core.async
;; scheduled executor always reads <10 from db and keeps track of last read
;; - track a system capacity in a ref/agent that gets updated as things are marked done/error
;; - work is put on a buffered TODO chan (capacity = our global capacity?)
;; TODO chan
;; worker does blocking take from TODO chan
;; - could have multiple workers pretty easily (and change this number easily)
;; - workers download take their config, grab their files, and run
;; - could have another queue for "doing work" (ready) vs. "downloading files?" (prep)
;; - just get files in a future, then re-queue them onto a new channel
;; - overkill for now, but maybe later?
;; done chan
;; error chan
;; - something alts these? and pushes into db and updates global capacity


;; Done
;; 1. put work onto the TODO queue
;; 2. take work off of the TODO queue and run it
;; 3. mark a job as "running" when it starts
;; 4. put successful jobs on the done queue
;; 5. process done queue
;; 6. put failed jobs on the error queue
;; 7. process error queue

;; TODO
;; 1. Move go-loops to a place
;; 2. better bailout handling of the go-loops (requeue work on exit)
